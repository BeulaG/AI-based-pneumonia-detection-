PROBLEM STATEMENT
Pneumonia kills over 740,000 children under five annually, mostly in regions like
Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Lack of affordable, real-time, non-invasive
diagnostics delays treatment and increases fatalities.
OUR SOLUTION:
    The tradition methods of detecting pneumonia can be done by physical examinations like listening to the lungs with a stethoscope, reviewing medical history and diagnostic tests like chest X-rays, blood tests and potentially sputum or pleural fluid cultures.These kind of physical examinations are not accurate and even these diagnostic tests are very difficult especially for babies, we can't do blood tests and taking X-ray. But this idea is "non-invasive" simply using cough we can detect pneumonia .In addition to that it's a user-friendly method and it gives an accurate results immediately. It also helps in earlier detection of Pneumonia. So definitely this will play a unbreakable role to decrease the global death rate of people particularly babies and children
